# This is a placeholder file for Apple Pay domain verification
# You need to download the actual file from your Stripe Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Settings > Payment methods > Apple Pay
# 2. Download the domain verification file
# 3. Replace this content with the actual file content
# 4. The file should be accessible at: https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association
